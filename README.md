# p5js-CMPO385
Final assignment for my music technology minor. Audio recorder and VFX using p5js.

This project uses the P5JS sound library to create an audio recorder/player. 
The user can click to record. While recording the VFX will give the user feedback on their volume input (green is quiet, red is loud).
When the user clicks again the recording will stop. On the third click the audio saves and the recording plays back.
The playback VFX uses FFT (fast fourier transform) to create its responsive visuals.
